Demonstrating the Impact of Various Prompting Techniques (Query Decomposition, Decision-Making, Semantic Filtering, etc.) in Generating Creative and Analytical Content using ChatGPT

Algorithm / Procedure:

Input Definition:

Define the target content type (e.g., report, article, case study, comic script).

Identify the AI model (e.g., ChatGPT or similar LLM).

Prompt Technique Selection:
Apply different prompting methods:

Query Decomposition: Break a complex question or task into smaller sub-queries to improve clarity and depth.

Decision-Making Prompting: Guide the model to evaluate options and make reasoned choices during content creation.

Semantic Filtering: Add semantic constraints (keywords, tone, or domain-specific vocabulary) to refine and focus the response.

Prompt Execution:

Feed the AI model with each structured prompt.

Example for comparison:

Simple Prompt: “Write an article on AI in education.”

Decomposed Prompt:

Explain the role of AI in education.

Discuss benefits and challenges.

Suggest future trends and ethical concerns.

Semantic Filtering Prompt: “Write a 500-word academic-style article on AI in education using a formal tone and references to real-world applications.”

Content Generation:

Generate outputs for each prompt type.

Collect and record the responses.

Evaluation Criteria:
Assess outputs using metrics such as:

Coherence: Logical flow and structure.

Relevance: Focus on the main topic.

Creativity: Novelty and imagination in expression.

Depth: Analytical and conceptual richness.

Comparative Analysis:

Compare the outputs to determine how each prompting method affects overall content quality.
